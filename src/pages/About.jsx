      <p>
        Mitchell is a proud Native American artist who, despite living with quadriplegia, creates breathtaking
        paintings by holding his brush with his mouth. His art honors his cultural heritage and reflects his
        deep connection to the landscapes he loves.
      </p>
      <p>
        His painting process is a unique blend of determination, skill, and passion, using tools adapted to his
        abilities to bring his visions to life.
